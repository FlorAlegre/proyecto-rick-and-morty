            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Rick Sanchez, a depressed, alcoholic, abusive, madman (who also happens to be a genius scientist with the
                ability to travel through dimensions) returns to his daughter Beth's life after two decades of being
                silent between the two. He finds her married to an incompetent, pathetic man named Jerry, and the couple
                has two teenage kids. Summer, the oldest girl, is a rebellious teen looking to have more friends at
                school, and Morty, the youngest child and a boy, is an anxious, quiet, and sweet kid. Rick makes Morty
                his sidekick and takes him on hilarious Interdimensional adventures, causing poor Morty to become
                steadily more miserable due to Rick's insane, abusive, and careless additude.</p>
